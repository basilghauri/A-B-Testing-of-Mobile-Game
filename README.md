# A-B-Testing-of-Mobile-Game
The data is taken from a mobile game called Cookie Cat. It represnts players progress throughout the game in which they encounter obstacles represented as gates that players have to cross either by waiting or doing in-app purchases. In this project we conduct an A/B test to study players retention rate if the first gate in the game is moved from level 30 to level 40.
